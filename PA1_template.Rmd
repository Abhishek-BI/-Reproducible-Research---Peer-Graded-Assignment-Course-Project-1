This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Loading activity
##First we need to load csv file in activity variable (Reader should set working directory before starting):

```{r }
#setwd("~/activity Science/Reproductive Research/Project 1")

#Load the activity:
activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```
#Converting the "date" variable to a Date classe and the "interval" variable to a factor:
```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)


```

# Histogram without NA values
##Histogram of total number of steps taken on each day is shown below:



```{r }
sum_steps<-aggregate(activity$steps,by=list(activity$date),FUN=sum,na.rm=TRUE) 

hist(sum_steps$x, 
      breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
      col="yellow", 
      xlab="Total number of steps", 
      ylim=c(0, 20), 
      main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n(NA removed)")
```

#Mean and Median of Steps
##Mean and median number of steps taken each day

```{r}
mean(sum_steps$x)
median(sum_steps$x)
```

#Time Series Plot
##Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

```{r}
avg_steps<-aggregate(activity$steps,by=list(activity$interval),FUN=mean,na.rm=TRUE)

colnames(avg_steps)<-c("interval","steps")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=steps),data=avg_steps)+geom_line()
```
#Maximum Average 5 minute interval
##The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

``` {r}
avg_steps[avg_steps$steps==max(avg_steps$steps),1]
```
##Replace NA values with the mean of the steps

```{r}
activity$steps[is.na(activity$steps)]<-mean(activity$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
```
##Here are some rows of new activity set
```{r}
head(activity)
```
#Histogram with Repaced NA values
##Histogram of total number of steps taken on each day is shown below:
```{r}
sum_steps<-aggregate(activity$steps,by=list(activity$date),FUN=sum,na.rm=TRUE) 

hist(sum_steps$x, 
      breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
      col="yellow", 
      xlab="Total number of steps", 
      ylim=c(0, 30), 
      main="Total number of steps taken each day\n(NA replaced by mean)")
```
##Mean and median number of steps taken each day after replacing NA values with mean
```{r}
mean(sum_steps$x)
median(sum_steps$x)
```

#Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
##Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

```{r}
# Convert date into weekdays

activity$days=tolower(weekdays(activity$date))

#Now categorised days into weekend and weekdays

activity$day_type<-ifelse(activity$days=="saturday"|activity$days=="sunday","weekend","weekday")

#Take mean steps taken on weekend or weekday in the intervals

avg_steps<-aggregate(activity$steps,by=list(activity$interval,activity$day_type),FUN=mean,na.rm=TRUE)

colnames(avg_steps)<-c("interval","day_type","steps")

# Create panel plot between average steps and interval seperated by day type

ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=steps),data=avg_steps)+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~avg_steps$day_type)
```
